ðŸš¦ *Traffic Light Controller Using Verilog* ðŸš¦  

Excited to share my latest project: a *Traffic Light Controller* designed in Verilog, bringing real-world functionality to digital design.  
 principles.  

*Project Highlights:*  
ðŸ”¹ *Clock Frequency*: 1 GHz for precise timing  
ðŸ”¹ *Light Durations*:  
  - *Red*: 20 ns (0)  
  - *Yellow*: 5 ns (001)  
  - *Green*: 20 ns (010)  
Itâ€™s all powered by a *Finite State Machine (FSM)* that ensures smooth and accurate transitions between signals (Red â†’ Yellow â†’Greenâ†’ Red....).

The project showcases efficient timing control and practical use of FSMs for signal management.
